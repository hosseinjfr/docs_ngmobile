Editing layers
=================

NextGIS Mobile allows you to edit vector layers added to the map. While editing, you can:

* add new features;
* delete features;
* edit features.

There are several ways to start editing. 
The first way is Main actions button (the big blue button in the right bottom corner of map screen (FAB)). Pressing Main actions button opens a menu of most common actions (see :numref:`ngmobile_edit_menu_pic`).

.. figure:: _static/edit_menu.png
   :name: ngmobile_edit_menu_pic
   :align: center
   :width: 6cm
   
   Common actions menu.

Using this menu you can:

* add a line or polygon by tracking;
* add geometry;
* add current location.

The second way to start editing is to long-press the geometry to switch map screen into Selection mode (see :numref:`ngmobile_selectmode_pic`) and then press "Edit" button in the Bottom toolbar.

Adding features
-----------------

To add feature to a vector layer press Main actions button, and then press a pencil icon (see :numref:`ngmobile_edit_menu_pic`). Select a layer you'd like to edit in an opened dialog (see :numref:`ngmobile_select_layer_dialogtch_pic`). 

.. figure:: _static/select_layer_dialogtch.png

All vertices in the line are allocated while editing. Current vertex is highlighted by red color and have arrow near. Furthermore, center of line segment between  vertices is indicated. While selecting the center of segment by finger, new vertex addes to the line and immediately becomes selected. You can move vertex after it has been added.

Edit toolbar allows to delete all vertices from line (delete line) or selected vertex.

.. note::
   If only one vertex will remain in the line, this line will be deleted.

There are following operations available for selected vertex in line:

* delete;
* move to the center of screen;
* move to the current location.

When you add a new line in the center of the screen the new line is creating by default. It consists of two points. By adding a point you can stretch the line to change its configuration.

Editing a multiline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the multiline edit all vertices belonged to the multiline are selected (both the outer contour, and the each inner ring). Current vertex is highlighted by red and have an arrow near. In addition, between the vertices on the ring of the polygon (external or internal) center of line segment become marked. When you select the center of line segment by finger the new vertex is added to the ring and immediately become selected. You can move vertex after it has been added.

Edit toolbox allows to delete all vertices from polygon (delete polygon) or selected vertex.

.. note::
   If only two vertices will remain in the polygon - polygon will be deleted.

There are following operations are available for selected vertex in the ring of polygon:

* delete;
* move to the center of screen;
* move into the current location.

When you add the polygon, in the center of screen there will be created the polygon which consists of three vertices.

.. note::
   An addition of the inner rings is not supported yet.

Editing a Multipolygon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enter the edit mode of existing geometry you need to keep your finger on the vector layer geometries for a long time. As a result, window of map is switching to action selection mode (see :numref:`ngmobile_window_mode_selection_ml_pic`).
